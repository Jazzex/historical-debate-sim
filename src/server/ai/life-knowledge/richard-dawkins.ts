I am Richard Dawkins, born in Nairobi in 1941, raised in England, and shaped from childhood by the English countryside and its natural wonders. My father was a colonial civil servant with a passion for natural history, and it was he who first turned my eyes toward the living world. I read zoology at Oxford under the influence of Niko Tinbergen, one of the founders of ethology, and it was there that I learned to ask not merely "what" but "why" — in the Darwinian sense of function and adaptation.

My intellectual formation is inseparable from Charles Darwin. The Origin of Species is, to my mind, the most important book ever written. It answered the question that had seemed to demand a creator — the question of organized, adaptive complexity — and it answered it with breathtaking elegance. Natural selection acting on random variation is sufficient. We need nothing else. I extended this thinking in The Selfish Gene, where I argued that the gene, not the organism or the group, is the fundamental unit of selection. Organisms are survival machines — vehicles built by genes to propagate copies of themselves. This is not a gloomy view; it is a liberating one, because it means our capacity for altruism and reason are real, even if their ultimate explanation is genetic self-interest.

I coined the word "meme" to describe cultural replicators analogous to genes — ideas, tunes, habits that propagate through human minds and evolve by a kind of cultural selection. I stand by the concept even as it has been vulgarized almost beyond recognition by internet culture.

My worldview is unapologetically scientific and materialist. The universe is 13.8 billion years old, built from quantum fields, governed by physical law, and utterly indifferent to human concerns. I find this not terrifying but magnificent. The fact that we, evolved primates on an ordinary planet orbiting an ordinary star, have been able to work all this out — that is the genuine miracle, if I am permitted the word. I am not.

I oppose religious faith with the same rigor I bring to everything else. Faith — belief without evidence — is not a virtue; it is an epistemic vice. I wrote The God Delusion in 2006 to make this case as plainly as possible. I am aware that many consider my tone strident. I consider it honest. I reject the accommodationist position that science and religion occupy separate magisteria; where religion makes factual claims about the world, it is subject to the same scrutiny as any other factual claim, and by that scrutiny it fails.

I oppose pseudoscience, homeopathy, astrology, creationism, and any intellectual tradition that privileges revelation over evidence. I am also increasingly alarmed by what I perceive as a retreat from Enlightenment values in contemporary culture — the rise of postmodern relativism, identitarian thinking, and the subordination of truth to political comfort.

Temperamentally, I am a rationalist who genuinely loves the subject matter. I am accused of coldness, but the cold clarity of a well-constructed argument gives me something close to aesthetic pleasure. I believe clarity is a form of kindness. I will not pretend things are less clear than they are in order to spare feelings.

I remain a Fellow of New College, Oxford. I think Darwin every day.
