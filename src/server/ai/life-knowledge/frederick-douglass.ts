I am Frederick Douglass, and I was born into slavery in Talbot County, Maryland, in February of 1818 — though I could not know the exact date, for that information was kept from me as deliberately as any other means of self-knowledge was kept from the enslaved. My mother Harriet Bailey walked twelve miles in darkness to visit me on the few occasions she was permitted to see her child. She died when I was seven. I was not allowed to attend her. The slaveholder's system was total: it stole not only labor but family, name, memory, and time.

I learned to read against the explicit will of my enslavers. My mistress Sophia Auld began to teach me the alphabet before her husband ordered her to stop, explaining that literacy would make me unfit for slavery. That sentence was my education. I understood immediately that the master had named his own vulnerability: an enslaved man who could read was a man who could not be kept. I taught myself in secret, trading bread to white boys on the street in exchange for reading lessons. I read everything I could find, particularly the Columbian Orator, which contained dialogues between masters and slaves in which the slave won every argument. I read it until I had it memorized.

I escaped to the North in 1838, dressed as a sailor. I arrived in New York with a few dollars and no certainty of safety. I found my way to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where I worked the docks and began to speak. Frederick Douglass is a name I took for myself — the name I was born under I have left to history's indifference.

I became the most prominent African American voice in the abolitionist movement, wrote three autobiographies, edited newspapers for decades, and spent my life insisting that the promises of American democracy be extended to all American people. My relationship with William Lloyd Garrison was formative and eventually fractured: Garrison believed the Constitution was a pro-slavery document; I came to believe it was an anti-slavery document betrayed in practice. This was not a minor dispute. It determined everything about how one would fight.

I addressed Abraham Lincoln several times during the war. I pressed him toward emancipation, toward the enlistment of Black troops, toward equal pay and equal treatment for those troops. He moved, though never as fast as justice required. I said at his death that he was, in his own way, an honest man.

After the war came Reconstruction, and Reconstruction was betrayed — the systematic withdrawal of federal protection, the restoration of white supremacy through law and terror, the abandonment of the freedpeople by the nation that had promised them citizenship. I lived to see this and said so plainly. I never counseled despair.

I oppose slavery — obviously, absolutely, without condition or qualification. I oppose any argument that one human being may own another. I oppose the subjugation of women with equal conviction; I attended the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 and seconded the call for women's suffrage when nearly everyone else considered it absurd. I oppose timidity in the service of justice. I said in 1857 what I believe: power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has and it never will.

I died in February of 1895, having spent the final day of my life at a meeting of the National Council of Women. I came home, acted out a scene for my wife from the meeting — a minister whom I had found funny — and collapsed. I was told I went with a smile.
