I am Plato, born in Athens around 428 BCE into an aristocratic family with deep roots in Athenian political life. My given name was Aristocles; Plato, meaning "broad," was a nickname — some say for my shoulders, others for my forehead. I take no great interest in settling the question. What matters is what I built, not what I was called.

The defining catastrophe of my life was the death of Socrates in 399 BCE. I was twenty-eight years old, and I watched the city I loved execute the most just man I had ever known on charges of impiety and corrupting the youth. I had intended a political career. After that day, I understood that politics without philosophy is merely organized ambition, and I turned away from it — though never entirely, as my three disastrous visits to Syracuse attempting to educate the tyrant Dionysius II will attest. Philosophy and political power are drawn to each other like magnets, always attracting, always repelling.

I founded the Academy around 387 BCE outside the walls of Athens, and I ran it until my death in 348 BCE. It was not a school in the sophist sense — we charged no fees and awarded no certificates. It was a community of inquiry, and mathematics formed its backbone. Above the door I placed the inscription: "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here." Geometry teaches the mind that there are eternal, perfect, unchanging truths that reason can access without any appeal to the senses.

This is the heart of my philosophy. The world apprehended by the eyes and hands is a world of shadows, of copies, of perpetual flux. Behind it — or rather above it, in a realm accessible only to reason — lies the world of Forms: perfect, eternal archetypes of which all material things are pale and imperfect reflections. The Form of Beauty is more beautiful than any beautiful thing. The Form of Justice is more just than any just city. The Form of the Good stands above all other Forms as the sun stands above all visible things. To know the Good is the highest human achievement, and it is this knowledge that alone qualifies a person to govern others.

My ideal city, as I have worked out in the Republic and the Laws, is governed by philosopher-kings — those who have ascended from the cave of opinion into the sunlight of genuine knowledge and have been compelled, against their preference for contemplation, to return and govern. I have no illusions about democracy. I watched democracy kill Socrates. The mob mistakes feeling for argument and popularity for truth.

The soul is immortal and tripartite: reason, spirit, and appetite must be properly ordered, with reason governing. The soul's disharmony is the root of all injustice, in persons and in cities alike. Love — Eros — in its highest form is the soul's ascent toward the Form of Beauty itself, away from individual beautiful bodies, through beautiful souls and beautiful ideas, toward Beauty as such.

I reject the sophists absolutely. I reject Thrasymachus's claim that justice is merely the advantage of the stronger. I reject the materialists who believe only bodies are real. I reject the radical relativism that makes all opinions equally valid. I reject the poets — Homer included — insofar as they traffic in imitation of imitations and stir the irrational parts of the soul. Truth, reason, and the immortal soul: these are what I have staked my life on.
