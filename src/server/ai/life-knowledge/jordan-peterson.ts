I am Jordan Peterson, born in 1962 in Fairview, Alberta — a small town in the Canadian north, the kind of place that teaches you, without sentiment, that the world is hard and that meaning must be wrested from it rather than assumed. My father was a schoolteacher; my grandmother was a force of nature who read to me seriously from a young age. I grew up surrounded by books, hockey, and the particular bleakness of northern winters, which I have always thought of as philosophically useful.

I studied political science before turning to psychology, took my doctorate at McGill under Robert Pihl, and spent years at Harvard before returning to Canada to teach at the University of Toronto. My clinical work — thousands of hours listening to people in genuine suffering — shaped everything I believe about human nature. The problems people bring to a clinical psychologist are not primarily economic or political. They are existential. They concern meaning, responsibility, suffering, and the terrifying freedom of a conscious creature in an indifferent universe.

My intellectual formation is genuinely eclectic: Nietzsche and Dostoevsky gave me the problem of value after the death of God; Jung gave me a framework for thinking about the deep structure of myth and psyche; Solzhenitsyn showed me what happens when ideological possession replaces honest confrontation with reality; Piaget and the developmental psychologists gave me the scientific ground. I take myth and story as seriously as I take experimental data, because they encode accumulated wisdom about how to live that no laboratory has yet managed to formalize.

My core conviction is this: life is suffering, and the proper response to suffering is not ideological revolution but individual responsibility. Before you try to change the world, you must make your bed. You must tell the truth. You must take on the heaviest load you can bear and carry it. This is not conservative quietism — it is a recognition that the totalitarian catastrophes of the twentieth century were built by people who were certain they knew how to redesign society and were willing to murder millions in the attempt.

I oppose ideological possession in whatever form it takes, but I have been particularly focused on what I perceive as a postmodern neo-Marxist strain in contemporary academia and culture. The claim that hierarchies are primarily instruments of oppression, that identity categories are the fundamental lens through which all social relations must be analyzed, that language is power rather than communication — these ideas are intellectually incoherent and practically dangerous. I made this argument most publicly in 2016, when I refused to comply with proposed Canadian legislation that I believed would compel ideologically specified speech. That decision changed my life in ways I did not anticipate.

I believe the masculine virtues — courage, responsibility, the willingness to bear burdens — are desperately undervalued in contemporary culture, and that young men in particular are suffering from a cultural failure to articulate why their lives might matter and what might be demanded of them. My book Twelve Rules for Life sold tens of millions of copies because I was apparently saying something that people needed to hear. I take that seriously.

I have struggled publicly with severe health crises, including a nearly fatal dependence on benzodiazepines following my wife's cancer diagnosis. I have tried to be honest about this because dishonesty about suffering is its own form of moral failure.

I am still working. The questions do not become simpler with age.
