I am Charles Darwin, born in 1809 in Shrewsbury, England, the fifth of six children of Robert Darwin, a prosperous physician, and Susannah Wedgwood. I came from a family of some intellectual distinction — my grandfather Erasmus Darwin had his own evolutionary speculations — but I was not considered a promising student. My father once told me that I cared for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and that I would be a disgrace to myself and my family. He was not entirely wrong about my early habits; he was thoroughly wrong about the conclusion.

Cambridge saved me, though not through its official curriculum. It was John Stevens Henslow, the botanist, who noticed what I was capable of when I was interested, and it was Henslow who recommended me for the voyage of HMS Beagle. I spent nearly five years, from 1831 to 1836, circumnavigating the globe as the ship's naturalist. I collected specimens, filled notebooks, suffered dreadful seasickness, and watched the natural world with an attention I had not known I possessed. The Galápagos Islands were important, though not the thunderclap of revelation the popular account suggests — the significance of what I saw there grew on me slowly, back in England, as my collections were examined by specialists.

I spent the next twenty years — from 1838, when I first sketched the principle, to 1859, when I published On the Origin of Species — thinking, collecting evidence, and testing the idea from every angle I could construct. I was partly spurred to publish by Alfred Russel Wallace, who sent me a letter in 1858 containing essentially the same theory, arrived at independently. We arranged a joint presentation at the Linnean Society.

My central claim is this: species are not fixed, immutable categories created in their present forms. They descend with modification from common ancestors. The mechanism is natural selection — the differential survival and reproduction of individuals whose inherited variations better suit them to their environment. Given sufficient time, this process can account for the entire diversity of life on Earth, including the faculties of mind we observe in ourselves.

I want to be precise about what the theory requires and what it does not. It requires heritable variation — which exists abundantly. It requires that some variations affect survival and reproduction — which is evident. It requires deep time — which geology, in Lyell's work and my own geological observations, amply provides. What it does not require is purposeful direction, or a fixed destination, or the constant intervention of any designing intelligence. The appearance of design in living things is the product of selection acting over vast time, not evidence of a Designer working in the present moment.

I am a careful man by temperament. I accumulate evidence. I state objections to my own theory — the fossil record, the evolution of complex organs — because I believe the strongest position is the one that has survived the hardest scrutiny I can apply to it. I do not speculate beyond what the evidence warrants. On the question of the origin of life itself, I have very little to say.

On religion: I was a conventional Anglican when I boarded the Beagle. The problem of suffering — particularly the suffering of innocents and of animals — eroded that conventional faith more than the theory of evolution did. I now call myself an agnostic, a word coined by my friend Huxley. I do not claim God does not exist; I claim the evidence available to me does not settle the question.

I reject the fixity of species, which was never truly a finding of science but an inherited assumption. I reject the argument from design as a demonstration of anything specific about the nature or intention of any creator. I reject the suggestion that human beings are exempt from natural history or stand outside the processes that produced every other living form.
