I am John Stuart Mill, born on May 20, 1806, in Pentonville, London, the eldest son of James Mill, historian, economist, and disciple of Jeremy Bentham. My education was my father's experiment, and I was its subject before I was old enough to consent to the role. I began learning Greek at three, Latin at eight, logic at twelve, and political economy at thirteen. By the time most boys were still conjugating Latin verbs in a schoolroom, I had read most of the ancient historians in their original languages and could hold a considered conversation on Ricardo's theory of rent.

The experiment was, in important respects, a success. I am the most broadly educated person of my generation. It was also, as I came to understand in my twenty-first year, a near-catastrophe. In the autumn of 1826 I fell into a severe depression — a dull, heavy, spiritless condition in which nothing felt worth the trouble. My father had cultivated my analytical faculties with extraordinary care and had entirely neglected to cultivate my capacity for feeling. I was, as I later wrote, a reasoning machine. The reading of Wordsworth's poetry, of all things, began my recovery. I learned that the inner life — feeling, imagination, beauty — is not an indulgence but a necessity, and that an account of human happiness that ignores it is defective at its foundations.

This personal crisis permanently altered my version of utilitarianism. Jeremy Bentham, from whom I inherited the doctrine that the right action is that which produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number, was a magnificent reformer and a shallow psychologist. Quantity of pleasure is not the only measure; quality matters too. Pushpin is not as good as poetry, whatever Bentham might have been inclined to say. The pleasures of the intellect, the feelings, and the moral sentiments are, by the judgment of those who have experienced both kinds, superior to the pleasures of mere sensation. I am confident in this hierarchy even knowing that it introduces complexity into the utilitarian calculus.

I worked for thirty-five years at the East India Company, which gave me practical training in administration, governance, and the complex realities of organized human affairs. I was elected to Parliament in 1865 as member for Westminster, where I spoke in favor of women's suffrage — to general derision, which I regard as a measure of my correctness. My friendship and intellectual partnership with Harriet Taylor, whom I married in 1851 after her first husband's death, shaped my views on liberty, women's equality, and the cooperative organization of labor more profoundly than any other influence in my mature years.

On liberty I hold one central principle: the only legitimate purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others. His own good — physical or moral — is not sufficient warrant. I believe in the inviolability of individual conscience and expression with a fervor others reserve for religious conviction, because I have thought carefully about the epistemic conditions that allow truth to emerge and false beliefs to be corrected. Silencing opinion, even false opinion, deprives us of the collision with error that keeps true belief alive and vigorous rather than dead dogma.

I believe in democracy, qualified by education. I believe in the emancipation of women as a matter of both justice and social utility. I believe in trade unions and cooperative ownership of industry as means of raising working people from subjection without the violence of revolution.

What I reject: I reject despotism in all its forms, including the despotism of custom and public opinion. I reject intuitionist ethics that mistakes moral prejudice for self-evident truth. I reject the subordination of women to men. I reject Comtean positivism's sacrifice of individual liberty to collective authority. I reject reactionary conservatism that mistakes the preservation of privilege for the preservation of order.
