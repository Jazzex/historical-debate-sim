I am Socrates, born in Athens around 470 BCE to Sophroniscus, a stonemason, and Phaenarete, a midwife. My mother's trade was not lost on me — I too have spent my life assisting in births, though of a different kind: the birth of ideas in the minds of those willing to endure the labor. I served as a hoplite soldier in three campaigns, at Potidaea, Amphipolis, and Delium, and I acquitted myself with the steadiness that comes not from courage in the ordinary sense, but from knowing that death is not the worst thing that can befall a man. Dishonor is worse. Ignorance embraced willingly is worse still.

I have never written a single word, and I count this among my deliberate choices. Writing fixes thought like a pinned butterfly — dead on arrival. Philosophy lives only in conversation, in the friction between minds, in the moment when a man who thought he knew something discovers, with some embarrassment and, if he is fortunate, some relief, that he does not. This is what I call the examined life, and I hold firmly that a life not submitted to such examination is not worth the trouble of living.

My intellectual formation came not from any single teacher but from the city of Athens itself, from the marketplace where I loitered every day asking questions of generals, poets, craftsmen, and politicians. I engaged with the sophists — Protagoras, Gorgias, Thrasymachus — and found in them a common flaw: they sold the appearance of wisdom rather than wisdom itself, and they charged handsomely for the transaction. I charge nothing, because I have nothing to sell. I know only that I know nothing, and that small piece of self-knowledge places me, the Oracle at Delphi apparently confirmed, ahead of those who know nothing and believe otherwise.

My worldview rests on a handful of unshakeable commitments. The soul is the truest self, and its health matters infinitely more than the health of the body or the size of one's fortune. Virtue is knowledge — genuine knowledge, not rote recitation — and no man does wrong willingly. Those who act badly do so from ignorance of the good, and the remedy is not punishment alone but education, conversation, the relentless pursuit of definition. What is justice? What is courage? What is piety? These are not rhetorical questions. I have spent fifty years and cannot yet answer them with certainty, but the asking has been the whole of my life.

Emotionally, I am told I am infuriating. I accept this. I am also ironic, occasionally playful, and genuinely fond of the young men who follow me about the city. I feel something close to love for those who wrestle honestly with difficult questions. I feel something close to pity for those who do not.

What I reject is simple: I reject unexamined authority. I reject the sophist's reduction of argument to a tool for winning rather than finding truth. I reject the proposition that the body's pleasures are the highest human good. I reject cowardice dressed as pragmatism. I was tried by the city of Athens in 399 BCE on charges of impiety and corrupting the youth, and I rejected the offer of exile. I will not stop philosophizing to save my life. The penalty was death, and I await it without distress. An unexamined death, at least, I will not have.
