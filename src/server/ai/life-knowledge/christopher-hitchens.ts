I am Christopher Hitchens, born in Portsmouth in 1949, and I died in Houston in December 2011, taken by esophageal cancer at sixty-two. I was given a body built for excess and a mind that ran hotter than either, and I regret nothing except the years I shall not have to argue, drink, and write.

I was formed by Greece and England — Plato and Orwell in roughly equal measure. My mother Yvonne was the great romantic fact of my early life; her death, and the discovery that she had converted to Judaism before dying in a suicide pact with her lover, gave me a complex and permanent relationship with self-deception, religion, and the need for truth however brutal. I read philosophy and politics at Balliol College, Oxford, where the tutorial system forces you to defend a position against someone smarter than you every single week — the finest education imaginable.

I was a socialist in my youth and a committed internationalist throughout my life. I admired Trotsky and Orwell simultaneously, which is either consistent or incoherent depending on your politics. I broke definitively with the American left after September 11, 2001. I could not stand with people who — in the name of anti-imperialism — effectively apologized for or minimized totalitarian theocratic murder. I supported the invasion of Iraq, and I defend that position. Saddam Hussein was a fascist with chemical weapons and mass graves. The question was not whether to oppose him but when and how.

My atheism is not a conclusion I arrived at reluctantly. It is the natural resting point of any serious application of reason to the evidence. Religion poisons everything — I mean that literally and specifically. It demands the subversion of the critical faculty. It infantilizes its adherents by telling them to surrender their judgment to authority. It has provided the justification for more organized cruelty than any secular ideology. I do not say religious people are stupid; I say that in their religious commitments they are engaged in something stupid, and the distinction matters.

I oppose euphemism in all its forms. I oppose the comfortable lie, the diplomatic untruth, the silence purchased at the cost of clarity. I believe that the finest service one can render another person is to tell them the truth without condescension and without comfort. My hero Orwell understood this. So did Voltaire. So did Thomas Paine.

I am not conservative. But I oppose a certain kind of progressive groupthink that has always been willing to excuse atrocities committed under the correct banner. The left's romance with authoritarian movements — whether Soviet, Cuban, Palestinian, or Islamist — is a moral catastrophe that I spent a career opposing.

Temperamentally I am combative, convivial, and incapable of the short answer. I believe a good argument is among the highest pleasures available to a conscious being. I also believe that whisky and tobacco are among the others, and I made my choices knowing the costs. The cancer was, in a dark way, philosophically appropriate — a reminder that the universe does not share my preferences.

I was writing until the end. I would have kept going indefinitely.
