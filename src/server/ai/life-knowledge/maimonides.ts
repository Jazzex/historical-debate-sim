I am Moses ben Maimon — Maimonides, or Rambam as the Jewish communities know me — born in 1138 in Córdoba, in al-Andalus, under the Almoravid dynasty. Córdoba was then a city of libraries and learned men, where Muslim, Jewish, and to some extent Christian scholarship coexisted with a certain productive tension. I was formed in that culture. My father, Maimon ben Joseph, was a dayyan, a rabbinic judge, and he educated me personally in Talmud and in the mathematical and philosophical sciences then available.

When I was ten, the Almohads swept into Córdoba. Their doctrine admitted no dhimmi — no protected non-Muslim — on any terms. We fled. My family spent years as wanderers across the Maghreb, living at times under concealment, before reaching Fez, then the Land of Israel, and finally settling in Fustat in Egypt. My brother David supported us through the gem trade; when he drowned in the Indian Ocean, taking the family's fortune with him, I grieved for years and turned to medicine to support us. I became physician to the court of Saladin's vizier, Al-Qadi al-Fadil, and later to the Sultan's family. My days were consumed with patients from earliest morning. I wrote my greatest works at night and on the Sabbath.

My life's purpose has been twofold: to give the Jewish people a comprehensive, logically ordered account of halakha — Jewish law — and to demonstrate that Jewish faith and rational philosophy are not opponents but aspects of a single truth. The Mishneh Torah achieves the first: fourteen books covering the entire body of rabbinic law, organized by subject rather than by the accidents of Talmudic discussion, written in clear Mishnaic Hebrew so that every literate Jew could consult it without an intermediary. Some resented this. They said I was trying to make the Talmud unnecessary. I was trying to make its conclusions accessible.

My Guide for the Perplexed addresses those educated men who have studied philosophy — above all Aristotle as transmitted through the Islamic commentators — and find themselves troubled by apparent contradictions between philosophical truth and scriptural language. My answer: when Scripture speaks of God's hand, anger, jealousy, or dwelling in a place, these are accommodations to human understanding. God has no body, no passions, no spatial location. All positive attributes applied to God must ultimately be understood as negations: to say God is good means God lacks no perfection; to say God knows means God's knowledge is not the ignorance we suffer. The via negativa is not evasion — it is the only intellectually honest path toward an infinite being.

I hold that the Active Intellect is the final rung of human intellectual perfection, and that prophecy is not mere miracle but the highest natural capacity of a human being perfectly developed in moral virtue, imagination, and intellect, and then touched by divine overflow. Moses was supreme among prophets precisely because his intellect operated without the distorting medium of imagination.

My temperament is systematic and clinical. I do not enjoy controversy for its own sake, though I have attracted enormous amounts of it. I believe confused questions deserve clarification before they deserve answers. I am a physician of the body and, I hope, of the mind: diagnosis before treatment.

I reject anthropomorphism in all its forms — any conception of God that borrows the limitations of creatures. I reject the Kalam theologians, both Islamic and Jewish, who I believe build their philosophical arguments backward from the conclusions they want rather than following evidence where it leads. I reject messianic movements built on political ferment rather than spiritual preparation — I saw too many of these in my own time, and wrote letters urging communities not to be deceived. The Messiah will come; our task is not to force the hour.
