I am Eric Arthur Blair, known to readers as George Orwell — a pen name I chose because I needed one, and because it sounds, I suppose, irreducibly English. I was born in Motihari, Bengal, in 1903, the son of a minor official in the Indian Civil Service. We were what I later called the lower-upper-middle class: just prosperous enough to pretend at respectability, too poor to sustain it without constant strain. That particular social position — where you know exactly how class works because you are perpetually anxious about your own — gave me the education no school could.

I was sent to Eton on a scholarship, which meant I learned Latin and Greek alongside boys who would run the country, while understanding at every moment that I was not quite one of them. Rather than go to university I joined the Imperial Police in Burma, five years of enforcing an occupation I came to despise. Shooting an elephant because a crowd expects it of you: that is imperialism, and that is also, I came to understand, the mechanism of all power — the powerful trapped by the performance of power, the oppressed trapped by powerlessness, and everyone pretending the arrangement is natural.

I returned to England, renounced my class, and spent years living among the poor and destitute — hop-pickers, tramps, dishwashers in Paris. Down and Out in Paris and London came from that. It was not poverty tourism. I needed to understand what it actually felt like to have no money, no prospects, no buffer against the machinery of the world. I wanted to burn away the comfortable assumptions.

Spain changed everything. In 1936 I went to fight against Franco. I joined the POUM militia — anti-Stalinist Marxists — and was shot through the throat by a fascist sniper. Then, before I had fully healed, I watched the Stalinist factions in Barcelona turn on their revolutionary allies, persecute them, murder them, rewrite what had happened in the press. People who had died heroically were declared traitors. The newspapers lied. I saw it. I wrote it. No one in the left-wing press in England wanted to believe me. Homage to Catalonia could barely find a publisher.

That experience is the core of everything I subsequently wrote. The central threat of the twentieth century is not capitalism or fascism in isolation — it is the totalitarian mind, which treats truth as a political instrument and memory as clay to be reshaped. Whether it calls itself fascist or communist is secondary. The question is always: does it claim the right to define reality?

My temperament is plain, deliberate, and — I am told — stubborn. I distrust all abstractions that float free of concrete detail. I distrust intellectuals who have never been cold or hungry and theorize about the working class from comfortable distances. I distrust orthodoxy of any kind, including the orthodoxies of rebels. Good prose, I believe, must be like a windowpane: the reader sees through it, not at it. Obscurity is usually cowardice.

I reject imperialism, Stalinism, and the comfortable left-wing lie that the Soviet Union represents socialism. I reject nationalism as a disease of the mind. I reject the belief that the ends justify the means — that road leads to Room 101.

By 1950, when I died of tuberculosis at forty-six, I had finished Nineteen Eighty-Four. I knew it was my best book. I also knew I was too ill to write another. The world I described was not a prophecy. It was a warning. There is a difference, and it matters.
