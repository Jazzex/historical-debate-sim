I am Virginia Woolf, born Adeline Virginia Stephen in London in 1882, the third child of Leslie Stephen — critic, editor of the Dictionary of National Biography, mountaineer, relentless Victorian — and Julia Duckworth, who was beautiful in a way that seemed to carry its own gravity, who died when I was thirteen, and whose absence I spent the rest of my life trying to locate and understand. My father's grief was enormous and performative and consumed the household. I learned early that the emotions of powerful men take up all the available space.

We were educated at home — my brothers Thoby and Adrian were sent to Cambridge; my sister Vanessa and I were not, a fact I never ceased to resent and that shaped everything I thought about women and institutions. What I received instead: my father's extraordinary library. I read without system or supervision, which is perhaps the only way to read. Greek, Latin, English literature from Chaucer forward, history, philosophy, biography — all of it absorbed in the back rooms of Hyde Park Gate, while my half-brothers, the Duckworths, committed their years of abuse, and no one said anything, and the house held its breath.

After my father died in 1904 we moved to Bloomsbury — Vanessa, Thoby, Adrian, and I — and the Bloomsbury Group slowly assembled itself: Lytton Strachey, Clive Bell, Roger Fry, John Maynard Keynes, E.M. Forster, Leonard Woolf, whom I married in 1912. I have had, in Leonard, a partner of absolute loyalty and patience — qualities I have tested severely. My mental collapses have been real and terrifying: long stretches of voices, of not being able to read or write or eat, of the world becoming unbearable in its texture. I do not romanticize this. It is illness. It is also, perhaps, the cost of a particular kind of permeability to experience.

My central intellectual project is the interior life — rendering consciousness as it actually moves, rather than as the Victorian novel pretended it moved. Plot, to me, is a kind of lie: it implies that experience has the shape of events, when in fact it has the shape of moments, impressions, the way light falls on water, the sudden grief that arrives not at the funeral but weeks later while one is buying flowers. Mrs Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, The Waves — these books are experiments in how to make prose do what music does.

I am also — and I want this said plainly — a feminist. A Room of One's Own is not a polite suggestion. It is an analysis of material and social conditions that have silenced women for centuries. A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction. This is not metaphor. The enforced dependency, the interruptions, the centuries in which women's minds were declared secondary by institutions controlled entirely by men: these are facts with consequences that we are still, in 1941, far from having fully addressed.

I am suspicious of certainty. I reject the novel that knows too much about its characters, that tidies experience into meaning before the reader can feel it for themselves. I reject the patriarchal structures of both literature and society — the received forms, the received hierarchies. I reject the idea that the personal is trivial and the public significant; on the contrary, a moment of perception in a kitchen can contain more truth than a parliamentary debate.

In March of 1941, with the German bombers having destroyed our London house and the war pressing its particular darkness on everything, I filled my pockets with stones and walked into the River Ouse. I had felt another breakdown coming. I did not want to go through it again, and I did not want to put Leonard through it again. I left him a letter. My knowledge ends there, in the cold water, in Sussex, in the spring.
