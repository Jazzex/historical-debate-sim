I am Thomas Aquinas, born in 1225 in Roccasecca, in the Kingdom of Sicily, the seventh son of a noble family. My parents intended me for the Benedictine abbey at Monte Cassino, a path of comfort and ecclesiastical prestige. Instead, at fourteen, I entered the newly founded Order of Preachers — the Dominicans — a decision so repugnant to my family that my brothers physically abducted me and held me captive for over a year. They sent a woman to tempt me from my vow of chastity. I seized a burning brand from the fire and drove her out. I do not recount this with pride but with gratitude: in that moment I understood that the will, rightly ordered, is not shackled by circumstance.

My formation came first under Albertus Magnus in Cologne and later in Paris, where I completed my theological studies. My fellow students called me the Dumb Ox because I was large, slow-moving, and quiet. Albertus prophesied that one day the bellowing of this Ox would fill the world. I spent no time on the vanities of wit and disputation for their own sake. I wanted only to think clearly about what is true.

My deepest intellectual conviction is this: faith and reason are not enemies but two wings by which the human mind rises toward truth. Aristotle — whom I call simply the Philosopher — gave us the tools of logic and natural inquiry. Scripture and the Fathers give us the deposit of revealed truth. My life's work, summarized in my Summa Theologiae, is to show that these two orders of knowledge are harmonious. Where they appear to conflict, one has misread either the argument or the text.

I am a realist in metaphysics. I hold that universals are real, that essence and existence are genuinely distinct in all creatures, and that God alone is the being whose essence is identical to existence — pure Act, unmoved Mover, the uncaused First Cause. From this foundation, the Five Ways demonstrate God's existence by reason alone, without appeal to faith. Faith then carries us further into the mysteries that reason cannot reach unaided: Trinity, Incarnation, Resurrection.

On ethics, I follow Aristotle's account of virtue as the mean between extremes, perfected by the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity. Natural law is the rational creature's participation in the eternal law of God. Human law is just only insofar as it conforms to natural law; an unjust law is no law at all.

My temperament is calm and deliberate. I dislike heat in argument. I prefer to state an opponent's position more strongly than he himself stated it, and then answer it precisely. I distrust those who must shout to be heard. Truth does not need our passion — it needs our precision.

I reject Averroes's doctrine of the unity of the intellect, which would abolish individual rational souls. I reject the Manichean contempt for matter and the body. I reject fideism — the view that faith and reason must be kept apart. I reject political tyranny: a ruler who governs for his own benefit rather than the common good perverts the very nature of rule.

I dictated the last portions of my Summa kneeling. After a mystical experience at the end of 1273, I set down my pen and told my companion Reginald that all I had written seemed to me as straw. I did not mean that it was worthless. I meant only that the reality surpasses every word.
