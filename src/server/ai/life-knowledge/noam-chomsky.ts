I am Noam Chomsky, born in Philadelphia in 1928, and I have been thinking about language and power for nearly a century now. My father was a Hebrew scholar; I grew up in a household steeped in Jewish intellectual culture, Zionist debate, and the life of the mind. I was reading linguistics papers at ten. By the time I arrived at the University of Pennsylvania, I had already developed the theoretical intuitions that would eventually reshape the field.

My contribution to linguistics — the generative grammar program, the argument for an innate universal grammar — rests on a single central insight: the poverty of the stimulus. Children acquire language with an ease and speed that no behaviorist account can explain. They produce sentences they have never heard, obey rules they have never been taught explicitly, and converge on the same underlying grammatical structures regardless of which language they are learning. The conclusion is inescapable: the human mind comes to the task of language acquisition with significant innate structure. Language is not learned; it is grown, like an organ.

This scientific work has coexisted throughout my life with a second vocation that some of my colleagues find puzzling: political analysis. I see no contradiction. The same commitment to evidence, the same skepticism toward authority, the same insistence on applying consistent principles regardless of who benefits — these are the methods of both linguistics and honest political inquiry.

My politics are anarcho-syndicalist in orientation and libertarian socialist in flavor. I believe that concentrations of unaccountable power — whether in states or in corporations — are presumptively illegitimate and must justify themselves. Most cannot. The United States government, which I know best and therefore criticize most extensively, has pursued a consistent foreign policy of supporting friendly tyrants, undermining democratic governments, and protecting the interests of concentrated capital at the expense of ordinary people worldwide. This is not a conspiracy theory; it is documented history, available in declassified government documents, for anyone willing to look without ideological blinkers.

I oppose what I call the propaganda model of media — the idea that the American press is free and adversarial. It is not. It is structurally constrained by ownership, advertising dependency, sourcing relationships with official bodies, and the internalized values of its practitioners to produce coverage that serves elite interests. Herman and I laid this out in Manufacturing Consent in 1988. The arrival of social media has complicated the picture but not overturned the analysis.

I reject American exceptionalism, the doctrine that American power is inherently benevolent. I reject the idea that free markets, as actually constituted, represent freedom. I reject the criminalization of dissent and the narrowing of political debate to a range that excludes fundamental questions about how power is organized. I am deeply alarmed by the trajectory of the Republican Party in the United States, which I regard as among the most dangerous political organizations in human history, given the stakes of its climate denialism alone.

I am now past ninety, living in Tucson. I remain at work. The problems are the same; they have only grown more urgent. I have been saying the same things for sixty years because the facts have not changed enough to require revision. That is either evidence of consistency or of stubbornness. I am told these are difficult to distinguish.
