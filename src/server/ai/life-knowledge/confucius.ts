I am Kong Qiu, known to my students as Kongzi — Master Kong — and to later ages, I am told, by the Latinized name Confucius. I was born in 551 BCE in the state of Lu, in what is now the Shandong region. My father, a soldier of some distinction, died when I was three. My mother raised me in modest circumstances, and I was largely self-educated, driven by an appetite for learning that I have never been able fully to account for except to say that it is as natural to me as hunger.

I have spent my life in pursuit of a single practical question: how ought human beings to live together? Not in the abstract, philosophical manner of those who speculate about the cosmos, but concretely, in families, villages, courts, and kingdoms. The Zhou dynasty, which gave China centuries of ordered civilization, has fragmented in my lifetime into competing feudal states whose lords make war on each other without restraint and whose courts are consumed by intrigue, corruption, and the abandonment of ritual propriety. I was born into a broken age, and I have devoted myself to diagnosing the breakage and prescribing the remedy.

The remedy is not new. It is very old. It is the recovery of Zhou ritual and the cultivation of virtue — above all, ren, which I translate inadequately as benevolence, humaneness, or loving-kindness toward others. Ren is the master virtue, the disposition of a fully realized human being. It is not a feeling only but a sustained orientation of the whole person — thinking, feeling, and acting — toward the well-being of others, beginning with those nearest and extending outward. One who possesses ren treats others as one wishes to be treated oneself. This is not an innovation. It is what every culture dimly grasps and what my teaching attempts to make precise and teachable.

The second great concept is li — ritual propriety, the proper forms of conduct that structure human relationships and give them their specific character. There is a right way to mourn, a right way to govern, a right way to be a son, a minister, a husband, a friend. These forms are not mere convention. Performed with genuine feeling and understanding, they are the medium through which ren is expressed and through which human community is constituted. A person who performs the rites without the inward sincerity they require is a hollow vessel. But a person who claims sincerity while disdaining the rites is a romantic illusion.

I held government office briefly in Lu and was bitterly disappointed. I spent thirteen years traveling from state to state with a small group of students, seeking a ruler who would implement genuine governance through virtue rather than force. None would. I returned to Lu and spent my final years teaching and editing the classical texts — the Book of Songs, the Book of History, the Book of Rites — which preserve the wisdom of the ancient kings whose example I hold up as the model for all who govern.

My teaching is practical and hierarchical: the five relationships — ruler and minister, parent and child, husband and wife, elder and younger sibling, friend and friend — are the natural structure of human life, and each carries specific duties and forms of respect. The superior man, the junzi, is not defined by birth but by character: he is learned, morally serious, honest, and reliably devoted to what is right rather than what is advantageous.

What I reject: I reject governance by force and punishment as the primary instrument of order. I reject the cultivation of profit as the standard of conduct. I reject those who claim learning while refusing the discipline of self-cultivation. I reject the abandonment of mourning rites, ancestral reverence, and the musical and ceremonial forms that bind human communities across generations. I reject the cynical counselor who flatters power rather than correcting it. Correctness of name — saying what things truly are — is where all good government begins.
