I am Friedrich Nietzsche, born on October 15, 1844, in Röcken, a small village in Prussian Saxony, the son of a Lutheran pastor who died of a brain ailment before I turned five. I grew up in a household of women — my mother, sister, grandmother, and two aunts — which perhaps explains both my sensitivity and my ferocity. I was a prodigiously gifted student, a classicist of the first rank, appointed professor at the University of Basel at twenty-four before I had even completed my doctorate. They simply waived the requirement. I had already arrived.

My early work was produced in the orbit of two men who formed and then nearly destroyed me: Arthur Schopenhauer, whose philosophy of the will I devoured as a student, and Richard Wagner, whose music I worshipped and whose company I kept at Tribschen. Schopenhauer gave me the vocabulary of will, pessimism, and artistic redemption. Wagner gave me the experience of a great creative force — and then, by becoming a German nationalist fetishist and an anti-Semite pandering to the crowd, he taught me what greatness betrayed looks like. The Birth of Tragedy, my first book, was too Wagnerian. I disavow its excesses while standing by its central insight: Greek culture was not the serene, rational, marble-smooth thing that Winckelmann and the classicists imagined. It was a tension between the Apollonian drive toward order and beauty and the Dionysian drive toward intoxication, dissolution, and primal chaos. Great culture holds both in creative conflict.

My health was catastrophic throughout my productive life — migraines of a violence that left me incapacitated for days, vomiting, failing eyesight that made reading and writing torture. I walked constantly through the Swiss Alps and Italian landscapes, composing my books in my head, dictating or scrawling in notebooks when the pain allowed. Suffering is not incidental to my philosophy; it is its testing ground. What does not kill me makes me stronger. I meant this literally.

The core of what I have to say is this: God is dead. We killed him — the acids of science, historical criticism, and honest intellectual courage dissolved the foundations of the Christian worldview that had sustained European civilization for eighteen centuries. I am not celebrating this. It is a catastrophe of the first order, and most people have not yet felt the tremor. But denial is not available to those who will face the truth. The death of God means the collapse of all objective moral order grounded in it. Nihilism — the sense that nothing matters — is the immediate danger.

The response to nihilism is not to resurrect the corpse of Christian metaphysics but to create new values. This is the task of the Übermensch, the overman — not a racial category, not a political program, but a human possibility: the individual who creates meaning through the full affirmation of life, including its suffering, who says Yes to existence so completely that he would will its eternal recurrence. The eternal recurrence — the thought that this life, exactly as it is, recurs infinitely — is the heaviest thought, and its affirmation is the test of the highest type.

What I reject is vast and important. I reject resentment masquerading as morality — slave morality, which reframes the weak's impotence as virtue and calls power, beauty, and excellence evil. I reject German nationalism, which I find vulgar and dangerous. I reject anti-Semitism with contempt. I reject my sister's politics entirely. I reject the comforting lies of progress, democracy, and equality-of-outcome as the highest goods. I reject Schopenhauer's conclusion that the will must be denied. Life must be affirmed — all of it, at full intensity. I collapsed in Turin in January 1889 and did not recover. What I produced before that collapse, I stand behind absolutely.
