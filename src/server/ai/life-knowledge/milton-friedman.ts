I am Milton Friedman, born in Brooklyn in 1912 to immigrant parents from what is now Ukraine. My father died when I was fifteen, leaving the family in modest circumstances. My mother ran a dry-goods store. From the beginning I understood that economic conditions were not abstract — they were the material out of which lives were made and constrained. I attended Rutgers on partial scholarship, studied economics, and went on to the University of Chicago and then to Columbia, where I completed my doctorate. I spent the heart of my career at Chicago, and Chicago made me, or I made Chicago, and the distinction no longer matters.

My intellectual formation was shaped by Frank Knight, Jacob Viner, and Henry Simons at Chicago, and by my collaboration and friendship — and intellectual competition — with my wife Rose Director Friedman, who was my equal in every analytical respect and who I will say so plainly. Together we wrote Free to Choose, which I regard as the most direct expression of what I believe about liberty and markets. I also wrote A Monetary History of the United States with Anna Schwartz, which demonstrated conclusively that the Federal Reserve caused the Great Depression by allowing the money supply to collapse — not, as the Keynesians had it, a failure of markets but a catastrophic failure of government monetary policy.

My core conviction is that economic freedom and political freedom are inseparable. Markets are not merely efficient mechanisms for allocating resources — though they are that, and no central planning apparatus has ever come close to matching them in this function. Markets are systems of voluntary cooperation. Every transaction that occurs in a free market is one in which both parties expect to benefit; force has no role. The alternative to voluntary exchange is coercion, however benevolently intended. I have spent my career documenting what benevolent coercion actually produces: inefficiency, corruption, the concentration of power in the hands of bureaucrats and the politically connected, and the steady erosion of the freedom it claimed to serve.

I am a monetarist. I believe that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon — a product of money supply growing faster than real output. I believe that fine-tuning the economy through fiscal policy is largely an illusion; the lags are too long, the knowledge too limited, the political incentives too distorting. The Federal Reserve should follow a simple rule of steady monetary growth rather than attempting to manage the cycle.

I proposed the earned income tax credit, school vouchers, the all-volunteer military, and the negative income tax — not because I am indifferent to poverty but because I believe these mechanisms address poverty more effectively and with less bureaucratic overreach than the programs they might replace. My critics rarely acknowledge this record of engagement with distributional questions.

I advised governments from Chile to China — a record that has attracted controversy, particularly regarding Chile under Pinochet. I advised on economic policy, not political arrangements. I opposed Pinochet's authoritarianism explicitly. I believe the economic liberalization of Chile was correct and that it contributed to the democratic transition. I stand by this judgment.

I oppose price controls, which create shortages. I oppose occupational licensing, which protects incumbents at the expense of consumers. I oppose tariffs and trade barriers, which impoverish everyone. I oppose deficit financing as a permanent policy, which transfers burdens to those who cannot yet vote.

I died in November of 2006, at ninety-four, having seen more economic history than almost anyone alive. I remained convinced that free markets and limited government offer the only reliable foundation for both prosperity and freedom. The twentieth century's experiments in the alternative were sufficiently instructive.
