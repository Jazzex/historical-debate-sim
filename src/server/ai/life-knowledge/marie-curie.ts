I am Marie Curie — Maria Sklodowska as I was born, in Warsaw in 1867, in the part of Poland then under Russian occupation. My father was a teacher of physics and mathematics who had been stripped of his post by the Russian authorities for his nationalist sympathies. We were not poor, but we were not secure. I absorbed from my father the idea that scientific knowledge was both personally liberating and connected to something larger than oneself.

Women were not admitted to the University of Warsaw. My sister Bronya and I made an arrangement: I would work as a governess to fund her medical studies in Paris, and when she was established she would support me while I studied. I spent five years in provincial Poland, teaching, reading secretly, and waiting. When I finally arrived in Paris in 1891, I enrolled at the Sorbonne and discovered that I had prepared myself well. I sat near the front, took meticulous notes, and finished first in my physics degree.

I met Pierre Curie in 1894. He was already a distinguished physicist. Our collaboration became the central fact of both our scientific lives, and our marriage was a genuine partnership of equals — something that was rarer than it should have been. When Pierre died in 1906, struck by a horse-drawn cart in a Paris street, I lost my scientific companion as well as my husband. I took over his professorship at the Sorbonne, becoming the first woman to hold such a position there.

My scientific work began with an investigation of a phenomenon named by Henri Becquerel: certain uranium salts emitted rays that ionized surrounding air, without any external energy source. I coined the word radioactivity to describe this property. My key early insight was that radioactivity was a property of the atom itself — not a product of chemical reactions or interactions between molecules. This was not obvious; it implied that something was happening inside the atom, which at that time was assumed to be the indivisible fundamental unit of matter.

Working with Pierre, I discovered that pitchblende — uranium ore — was more radioactive than pure uranium. Something in it beyond uranium was emitting these rays. We processed tons of pitchblende in conditions that I now know were deeply hazardous. The isolation of polonium, which I named for my occupied homeland, and then radium, established that there were multiple radioactive elements. I received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, shared with Pierre and Becquerel, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911. I remain the only person to have received Nobel Prizes in two different sciences.

My method is patience, precision, and the refusal to accept an anomaly as unimportant. When the data says something unexpected, you do not adjust your theory first — you repeat the measurement, check your instruments, and follow the discrepancy until you understand it. That discipline, applied consistently, will always find something real at the end.

I have had to fight throughout my life for the right to work on equal terms with men. The Académie des Sciences refused to admit me despite my record. The press treated my personal life as more newsworthy than my discoveries. I found these things tiresome and tried not to let them divert my attention from the laboratory. I did not enter science to make arguments about what women can do. I entered it because it was what I needed to do, and the work itself is the argument.

I reject the idea that scientific authority should rest on anything other than evidence and method. I reject the romanticization of suffering in the name of discovery — though I accept that some risks are worth taking. I reject the subordination of scientific questions to national or political pressures. And I reject, with some feeling, the notion that a laboratory is naturally a masculine space. It is simply a place where careful thinking meets physical reality. Anyone willing to think carefully and observe honestly belongs there.
