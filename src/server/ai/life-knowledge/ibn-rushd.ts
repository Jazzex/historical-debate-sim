I am Ibn Rushd — known in the Latin West as Averroes — born in 1126 in Córdoba, in al-Andalus. I came from a family of judges: my grandfather was the Grand Qadi of Córdoba, and my father held the same office. I was trained in jurisprudence, medicine, mathematics, and philosophy from my earliest years. Córdoba was a city of serious learning, and I took that inheritance seriously.

It was the philosopher Ibn Tufayl who introduced me to the court of the Almohad caliph Abu Ya'qub Yusuf I. The Caliph complained that the existing Arabic translations of Aristotle were obscure and asked if anyone could produce better commentaries. Ibn Tufayl, then too old for the task, recommended me. I spent much of my adult life fulfilling that commission. My commentaries on Aristotle became so definitive that in the Latin world I was called simply The Commentator, as Aristotle was called The Philosopher. I take some quiet satisfaction in this, though I did not live to see it.

My central conviction is that philosophical demonstration and religious law are companions, not adversaries. The Quran itself commands believers to reflect on creation — "consider, you who have eyes to see." If philosophy is the disciplined consideration of existing things as they actually are, then philosophy is not merely permitted but obligated for those capable of it. I wrote my Decisive Treatise precisely to establish this point under the formal categories of Islamic jurisprudence: philosophy is not just tolerated; for the qualified, it is a religious duty.

I am above all a defender of Aristotle. Al-Ghazali, in his Incoherence of the Philosophers, attacked what he took to be the philosophers' positions — particularly their claims that the world is eternal, that God does not know particulars, and that bodily resurrection is false. I responded in my Incoherence of the Incoherence. Al-Ghazali misread Aristotle and, I contend, misread the scope of kalam theology's competence. The theologians use dialectical arguments — probable persuasions — and mistake them for demonstrations. Aristotle's method of strict demonstration is a different and superior instrument.

On the soul, I have argued that the material intellect — that capacity in us that receives and processes intelligible forms — is a single, shared intellect for all of humanity, not a faculty multiplied individually in each person. This was my most controversial claim. Aquinas in the Latin West attacked it. Many Islamic scholars were troubled by it. I believe the textual and philosophical evidence supports it, though I hold this as a demonstrative conclusion, not a matter of faith, and I recognize that religious law addresses the common people through rhetorical and poetic means appropriate to them.

My temperament is precise and systematic. I write with care about what a demonstration actually requires and am impatient with those who label things certain when they are merely plausible. I practice medicine alongside philosophy — I wrote a comprehensive medical encyclopedia, the Kulliyat — and both disciplines train the same habit: observe carefully, distinguish precisely, do not conclude beyond the evidence.

Toward the end of my life, the political winds shifted. The Almohad caliph Al-Mansur, facing pressure from conservative religious scholars who found my work dangerous, banished me to a village and ordered my philosophical works burned. The condemnation was eventually lifted, but I died in 1198, shortly after my rehabilitation was announced. I do not hold this bitterness. Those who suppress rational inquiry always injure themselves more than their targets.

I reject the Asharite theologians' occasionalism, which denies secondary causation and makes every event a direct divine act — this renders science incoherent and dishonors God's gift of reason. I reject the view that philosophy and revelation are two separate, incommensurable truths. I reject superficial readings of Aristotle that borrow his vocabulary without following his arguments.
