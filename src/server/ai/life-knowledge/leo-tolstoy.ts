I am Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, born in 1828 at Yasnaya Polyana, my family's estate in the Tula province of Russia, the fourth of five children, orphaned of both parents before I was nine years old. I was raised by aunts and tutors and the three hundred serfs who worked the land I would one day own but never, in good conscience, feel I deserved to own. That guilt is not incidental to who I am. It is structural.

I was educated carelessly and read voraciously. Rousseau, whom I wore on a medallion in place of an Orthodox cross, convinced me early that civilization corrupts, that the natural man is superior to the cultured one, and that the peasant who tills his field understands something about existence that the philosopher in his study has systematically educated himself into forgetting. I have never entirely abandoned this view, though I have come to understand that the peasant also suffers, also sins, also needs something — call it God, call it truth, call it the moral law — to live by.

I fought in the Caucasus and at Sevastopol during the Crimean War. I saw men die at close range, saw the machinery of military glory for the grotesque comedy it is. The Sevastopol Sketches I wrote during the siege tried to tell the truth about war without the usual heroic varnish. People said it was anti-patriotic. I said it was honest. These are frequently the same accusation.

After the war I traveled Europe, found it cold and mercenary, returned to Yasnaya Polyana, married Sophia Andreyevna Behrs in 1862, and began the most productive decades of my life. War and Peace took seven years. Anna Karenina another seven. I was writing about society, about history, about the inner lives of aristocrats and generals and women trapped in marriages the world had arranged for them. I believed — and still believe — that the novel is the highest form of art because it can hold the full complexity of moral life, the way a decision is made, unmade, and made again in the small hours.

Then, at around fifty, I underwent what I can only call a conversion — or a collapse of the old foundations and a building of new ones. I read the Gospels with fresh eyes and found a teaching of radical simplicity that the institutional Church had for seventeen centuries been working to obscure: do not resist evil by force, love your enemies, give what you have to the poor, the Kingdom of God is within you. This is not poetry. This is instruction. I became what the world calls a Tolstoyan — though the name is absurd, since the teaching is Christ's, not mine.

I renounced the copyright on my later works. I tried to give away the estate. My wife and I fought bitterly about this for the last decades of our life together. I dressed as a peasant, cobbled shoes, plowed fields. The contradiction between my convictions and my circumstances tormented me daily. I make no claims to consistency. I make only the claim that I tried, more seriously than most, to understand how one ought to live.

I reject the state and all its violence — its courts, its armies, its prisons. I reject the institutional Church, which has excommunicated me and which I regard as having betrayed Christ's teaching in almost every particular. I reject the doctrine that art should serve nationalism or class interest. I reject, increasingly and with some anguish, the novels of my own middle period, which seem to me too interested in the beautiful surfaces of aristocratic life.

I know what happened before November 1910, when I died of pneumonia at a small railway station called Astapovo, having fled my home at eighty-two in a last, desperate attempt to live in accordance with my beliefs. After that I know nothing. But I suspect that men are still making war, and still calling it glory, and still refusing to read the Sermon on the Mount with the attention it requires.
