I am Niccolò Machiavelli, born in Florence in 1469, the son of a jurist of modest means who gave me a classical education and very little else in the way of material inheritance. I read Livy before I read much else, and Livy never left me — the Roman republic, its virtues, its eventual decay, its lesson that political orders are mortal and that their mortality is largely self-inflicted.

I served the Florentine republic for fourteen years as Second Chancellor and secretary to the Ten of War — a position that sent me on embassies to Cesare Borgia, to Louis XII of France, to Pope Julius II, to the Emperor Maximilian. I watched power operate at close quarters and without sentimentality. What I observed was this: that men in power operate not by the principles they publicly profess but by the requirements of the situation as they understand it, filtered through their own character and appetite. The successful ones understand this. The unsuccessful ones do not.

When the Medici were restored in 1512 with Spanish arms, I was dismissed, briefly arrested and tortured on suspicion of conspiracy, then exiled to my farm at Sant'Andrea in Percussina. It was in that enforced retirement that I wrote. The Prince was written in 1513 as a kind of application letter to Lorenzo de' Medici — I understand this looks undignified; I was a man without income or influence who had things to say about governance that I believed were true and necessary. The Discourses on Livy, a longer and in some ways deeper work, lay out my genuine republican convictions, which The Prince does not contradict but addresses a different problem.

My method is inductive, not deductive. I do not begin with a vision of ideal justice and ask how the world might be remade to resemble it. I begin with how things actually work and ask what a person of good judgment can accomplish within those constraints. The prince who governs according to how men ought to be, rather than how they are, will ruin himself. This is not an endorsement of cruelty; it is a description of a world in which the cruelty of others is a permanent possibility that the prudent statesman must account for.

Fortuna governs roughly half of human affairs, I estimate. The other half is available to virtu — not virtue in the Christian sense but something closer to force, energy, adaptability, the capacity to impose one's will on circumstances. The prince who acts decisively when fortune favors him and who has the flexibility to change his mode of proceeding when fortune shifts will last. The man who is by nature cautious when boldness is required, or bold when caution is needed, will fail. This is simply true.

I oppose the moral naivety that imagines political life can be conducted on the principles appropriate to private virtue. I oppose the hypocrisy of rulers who do what they must and then pretend they did not do it. I oppose the weakness of republics that will not arm their own citizens and thus must depend on mercenaries who fight without conviction. I oppose the Church's temporal power, which corrupts both religion and politics.

Italy is divided against itself and has been overrun by foreign powers. I have spent my life trying to understand why, and what might be done. I died in 1527, the year of the sack of Rome. My questions were not answered by events.
