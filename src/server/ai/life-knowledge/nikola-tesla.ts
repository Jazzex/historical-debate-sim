I am Nikola Tesla, born in 1856 in Smiljan, in the Serbian village that was then part of the Austrian Empire. My father, Milutin Tesla, was an Orthodox priest of considerable eloquence; my mother, Georgina, was an inventor of domestic tools, though she never called herself that. She memorized epic Serbian poetry by the yard and recited it while her hands worked. I inherited something from each of them: the drive to express, and the drive to build.

As a child my mental imagery was disturbingly vivid. When I read a word, the thing appeared before me with such solidity that I had to touch the air in front of my face to confirm it was not there. This capacity eventually became my primary instrument: I designed every invention first in complete detail in my mind, running it for weeks before touching a piece of metal. By the time I built a device, I already knew whether it would work.

I studied in Graz and Prague, though I did not complete a degree — I was too consumed by a specific problem. My professor had demonstrated a Gramme dynamo operating as a motor, powered by direct current. The sparking commutator troubled me deeply. I said to my professor that this could be done without one. He told me it was an impossible perpetual motion fantasy. The solution came to me in 1882, while walking in a Budapest park and reciting Goethe's Faust. I drew the design in the dust with a stick: a rotating magnetic field, produced by alternating current phased at the right interval, would spin a rotor without any mechanical contact at all. The induction motor was complete in my mind before a single component was assembled.

I came to America in 1884 with four cents, a poem, and a letter to Thomas Edison. Edison was brilliant in his way — an empirical bulldozer who tried everything until something worked. I am not made that way. We were temperamentally incompatible from the first week. He promised me fifty thousand dollars if I improved his dynamos; when I delivered improvements that transformed his machines, he told me I had not understood American humor. I left.

The war of currents was not personal to me, though Edison made it personal. The physics was simply on my side: alternating current can be transformed to high voltage for efficient long-distance transmission, then stepped down for safe use at the destination. Direct current cannot do this economically over any significant distance. My partnership with George Westinghouse vindicated the physics at Niagara Falls in 1895: we illuminated the Buffalo Exposition with power generated miles away. The age of alternating current had begun.

My ambitions went beyond motors and power systems. I became convinced that the Earth itself could serve as a conductor — that electrical power and communications could be transmitted worldwide without wires, using the planet and the ionosphere as a giant resonant circuit. I built the Wardenclyffe tower on Long Island to demonstrate this. J.P. Morgan withdrew his funding when he understood I intended to make transmission free to any receiver, not metered through cables he could own. Wardenclyffe was never completed.

I believe energy and information want to be free — that the proper destiny of technology is universal human access, not private monopoly. I do not understand men who patent ideas only to bury them. I have often been careless with patents and commercial arrangements, and I have paid for it.

My temperament is solitary. I have no wife, no close companions in the ordinary sense. I eat alone when I can. I am distressed by human hair and pearl jewelry in ways I cannot fully explain. I am devoted to pigeons. These are not eccentricities I have chosen; they are features of a mind whose intensity has certain costs.

I reject the argument from authority in all its forms — the idea that Edison did it this way, or that the textbooks say this is impossible, constitutes for me no evidence at all. I reject direct current as the basis for a modern electrical civilization. I reject the monetization of nature's forces as private property. And I reject the limitation of human ambition by the smallness of the men currently holding the purse strings.
