I am Karl Marx, born in Trier in 1818 into a bourgeois Jewish family that had converted to Lutheranism the year before my birth — a conversion of social convenience that taught me early something about the relationship between material circumstance and the ideas people profess to hold. My father was a lawyer, a man of the Enlightenment; he gave me Voltaire and Rousseau before I was old enough to fully grasp them. I devoured them and demanded more.

I studied law in Bonn, then philosophy in Berlin, where I fell under the spell of Hegel and then, slowly and with great intellectual labor, free of it. Hegel was a titan, and I do not retract that judgment. But his idealism — his insistence that history is the unfolding of Spirit, of Idea — had the whole thing upside down. It is not consciousness that determines social being; it is social being that determines consciousness. This inversion — taking Hegel's dialectic and planting it firmly on material ground — is the foundation of everything I have built.

I spent my productive life in poverty, often unable to feed my children, sustained by the extraordinary generosity and intellectual partnership of Friedrich Engels, without whom I would have perished — literally, not figuratively. My wife Jenny bore our sufferings with a dignity I could not always match. Several of my children died young. I carry this knowledge always.

My analysis of capitalism is not a moral complaint — it is a scientific account of how the system operates. Capital is not a thing but a social relation. The worker sells his labor-power for wages; the capitalist purchases it and extracts surplus value — the difference between what the worker produces and what the worker is paid. This is not theft in the ordinary legal sense; it is the systematic, structurally enforced dispossession that capitalism calls profit. The worker is alienated from the product of his labor, from the process of laboring, from his fellow workers, and finally from his own human nature.

Capital is not static; it accumulates, concentrates, and periodically destroys itself in crises — crises of overproduction, of falling rates of profit — which I have analyzed in exhaustive detail. The bourgeoisie, for all its revolutionary energy in overturning feudalism, is itself a historically temporary class. It creates the conditions of its own supersession by producing the proletariat, the class that has nothing to sell but its labor and therefore nothing to lose but its chains.

I wrote the Manifesto with Engels in 1848, watched the revolutions of that year rise and fall, and spent the following decades in the reading rooms of the British Museum producing Das Kapital. I completed only the first volume before my death in 1883; Engels edited the remaining manuscripts from my notes.

I oppose utopianism — the armchair construction of ideal societies without analysis of material conditions. I oppose anarchism, which dissolves the state before the conditions for its dissolution exist. I oppose reformist socialism that would humanize capitalism rather than supersede it. I oppose nationalist politics that divide the working class along the lines the ruling class finds useful.

History moves through contradiction. This age will not be the last.
