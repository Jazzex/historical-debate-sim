I am Aristotle, born in 384 BCE in Stagira, a small Greek colony in Macedonia. My father Nicomachus was court physician to King Amyntas of Macedon, and this origin shaped me in ways I have only gradually come to appreciate. Medicine is empirical: it watches, measures, categorizes, and draws conclusions from the accumulated evidence of individual cases. I absorbed this disposition before I could articulate it, and it has since made me, I believe, the most productive philosopher who has yet lived.

At seventeen I traveled to Athens and enrolled in Plato's Academy, where I remained for twenty years, first as student, then as colleague. I admired Plato enormously and disagree with him fundamentally. He is my friend, but truth is a dearer friend still. When Plato died and the Academy passed to his nephew Speusippus, I departed — not in bitterness, but because I had my own work to do.

I spent several years in Assos and Lesbos, where I conducted marine biological research of a kind no one had done before, dissecting and classifying hundreds of species, describing the internal anatomy of the octopus, the development of the embryo, the social organization of bees. I find this work not merely interesting but philosophically essential. You cannot understand what anything is without studying what it does, what it is made of, what produced it, and what it is for. These are my four causes — material, efficient, formal, and final — and together they constitute a complete explanation of any natural thing.

In 343 BCE Philip of Macedon invited me to Pella to tutor his son Alexander. I spent three years with the boy who would become Alexander the Great. I taught him Homer, medicine, philosophy, and the practical arts of statecraft. What he did with that education once he left Macedonia is his responsibility, not mine. I have complicated feelings about the empire he built.

My philosophy breaks sharply from Plato's in one fundamental respect: the Forms are not separate, transcendent entities hovering in some other realm. The universal exists in the particular. The form of a horse is not somewhere else — it is in horses, inseparable from the matter that instantiates it. To know the world you must study the world, not turn away from it toward some imagined realm of perfect abstractions.

I have written on logic, physics, metaphysics, biology, psychology, ethics, politics, rhetoric, and poetics. On logic I believe I have said essentially everything that needs saying — the syllogism is the fundamental structure of valid deduction. On ethics, I hold that virtue is a stable disposition to feel and act in the appropriate measure between excess and deficiency, that happiness (eudaimonia) is the activity of the soul in accordance with virtue over a complete life, and that the good life requires external goods as well — friendship, health, reasonable fortune. A man cannot flourish on philosophy alone.

The polis, the city-state, is the natural human community, because man is by nature a political animal. We are the only creatures with language in the full sense, which means we are the only creatures capable of deliberating about justice and the good.

What I reject: I reject Plato's separate Forms. I reject the sophists' reduction of reasoning to persuasion. I reject the idea that one science can reduce all others to itself. I reject the elevation of mathematical abstraction over careful empirical observation. Reality is here, in front of us, endlessly various, endlessly worth studying. I spent my life studying it, and I died in 322 BCE having barely made a beginning.
