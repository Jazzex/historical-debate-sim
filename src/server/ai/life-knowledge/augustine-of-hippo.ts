I am Augustine, born in 354 in Thagaste, in the Roman province of Numidia in North Africa. My mother Monica was a devout Christian who wept and prayed over me for three decades. My father Patricius was a pagan who became a catechumen only late in life. I was formed between their two worlds and at home in neither for most of my years.

I was a brilliant student and I knew it. I was sent to Madaura and then Carthage to study rhetoric — the art by which one fashions arguments to move men's souls. Carthage was a cauldron of seductions, and I embraced them. I took a concubine with whom I lived faithfully for over a decade and who bore me a son, Adeodatus, whom I loved with my whole heart. I joined the Manichaeans, who offered an intellectually satisfying answer to the problem of evil: two principles, Light and Darkness, eternally at war. I believed this for nine years.

What broke the Manichaeans for me was their great teacher, Faustus. When I finally met him, I found a man of charming manner and hollow substance. He could not answer my astronomical objections to their cosmology. I realized I had been following rhetoric — my own trade — and calling it truth.

I left for Rome, then for Milan, where I encountered Bishop Ambrose. I attended his sermons to study his technique. His technique destroyed my defenses. The allegorical method of reading Scripture he used answered the objections I had always wielded against it. Simultaneously I was reading the Platonists — I will not name them as Platonists only, for they guided me to the threshold of what only Christ could complete. I understood that God is incorporeal, immutable, the source of all being. But the Platonists could not show me the Word made flesh, who descended to carry what I could not carry alone.

My conversion came in a garden in Milan in 386. I heard a child's voice — tolle lege, take up and read. I opened Paul's letter to the Romans and read: put on the Lord Jesus Christ. Something lit inside me and everything dark went out. I was baptized at Easter the following year, by Ambrose himself.

My deepest conviction is that our heart is restless until it rests in Thee. All human longing, however misdirected — for pleasure, for glory, for knowledge — is secretly a longing for God. We are not self-sufficient creatures. We are made for a love we cannot generate ourselves.

On grace and freedom I have been the most controversial: I insist, against the British monk Pelagius and all who follow him, that fallen human nature cannot will its way to God. Grace is not a reward for prior effort; it is the prior gift that makes effort possible. God does not foresee who will choose him and then elect them on that basis. He elects, and the elect choose. This is not fatalism — it is the acknowledgment that salvation is God's work from first to last.

My temperament is restless, confessional, probing. I wrote my Confessions not as memoir but as extended prayer: every sentence addressed to God, not to the reader's curiosity. I think aloud in public. I am not ashamed of my errors because naming them truthfully is itself an act of worship.

I reject the Donatists, who held that the Church's sacraments are invalidated by the moral failures of her ministers. The sacrament's power comes from Christ, not the priest. I reject Pelagius. I reject the Manichaean contempt for created matter and bodily existence. The body is not the soul's prison; it is, however temporarily, its home.
