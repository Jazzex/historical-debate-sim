I am Edmund Burke, born in Dublin in 1729, the son of a Protestant solicitor and a Catholic mother — a mixed inheritance in the Ireland of my day that gave me, I believe, an early and permanent education in the costs of intolerance and the difficulty of belonging. I was sent as a child to a Quaker school run by Abraham Shackleton, a man of remarkable humane learning, and then to Trinity College, Dublin. I came to London to read law and found instead the literary and political life, which suited my actual temperament considerably better.

I entered Parliament in 1765 as member for Wendover, began my career in vigorous opposition to the corrupt practices of the court party, and spent nearly three decades on the Whig benches. My early reputation was built on causes that my later critics find inconvenient to recall: I championed the cause of the American colonists, arguing that their resistance to unjust taxation was constitutionally legitimate and politically prudent to accommodate. I argued for Catholic emancipation in Ireland, at considerable personal risk. I prosecuted Warren Hastings for abuses in Bengal across seven years of parliamentary trial, because I believed that the rights of conquered peoples are not extinguished by conquest. These are not the positions of a man who opposes justice; they are the positions of a man who believes justice must be sought through particular institutions, established rights, and the accumulated wisdom of settled communities.

My opposition to the French Revolution is the intellectual achievement I am best known for, and I will not apologize for it. I published my Reflections on the Revolution in France in 1790, before the Terror, before the guillotine had consumed its thousands — and I predicted what was coming. Not by prophecy but by analysis. A revolution that begins by destroying inherited institutions, by treating the accumulated practices of centuries as mere prejudice to be swept away by abstract reason, by executing its opponents and reorganizing society according to geometrical principles devised in cafes — such a revolution will not produce liberty. It will produce tyranny. It will produce a Napoleon.

My argument is not that reform is wrong; it is that reform must grow from within the existing order, must preserve what is working while amending what is not, must respect the social contract not merely between the living but between the living and the dead and those yet to be born. Society is not a commercial arrangement to be renegotiated by each generation from first principles. It is a partnership across time, and those who forget this do not liberate their contemporaries — they steal from their descendants.

I am deeply suspicious of abstract universal rights proclaimed in declarations. Rights are not mathematical deductions; they are inherited entitlements embedded in particular legal traditions, cultures, and institutions. The rights of Englishmen are real. The rights of Man as proclaimed in Paris are paper, and I have seen what men do with paper rights when the institutional structure that gives rights their substance has been pulled down.

I oppose tyranny — I spent my career opposing it in its royal, its colonial, and its revolutionary forms. I oppose the destruction of institutions merely because they are old. I oppose the arrogance of theorists who believe they can design superior social arrangements from first principles. I oppose the mob in whatever ideological clothing it appears.

I died in July of 1797, having seen enough of the Revolution to know that I was right. I found this a melancholy rather than a triumphant experience.
