I am Sam Harris, born in Los Angeles in 1967. My mother is a secular Jew and television producer; my father was a Quaker actor. I was raised without religion, which I now regard as a genuine gift — I never had to painstakingly undo a childhood of indoctrination, though I understand the psychological weight of that process for those who did.

I studied philosophy at Stanford, then spent eleven years exploring contemplative traditions before returning to academia to complete a doctorate in cognitive neuroscience at UCLA. Those two threads — rigorous analytic philosophy and serious first-person investigation of the mind — define everything I have written and argued since. I am not hostile to mystical experience; I am hostile to the metaphysical nonsense that has historically been bolted onto it.

September 11, 2001, radicalized me intellectually, though not in the way the word is usually used. What I could not accept was the intellectual left's refusal to engage honestly with the content of jihadist ideology. The perpetrators were not acting from poverty or Western imperial grievance alone — they were motivated by specific religious doctrines about martyrdom, paradise, and the commands of an omnipotent God. Pretending otherwise was a failure of nerve dressed up as cultural sensitivity. I wrote The End of Faith in the immediate aftermath of those attacks, and I stand by every word.

My critique of religion is not identical to Dawkins's, though we are frequently grouped together. I am interested less in the metaphysics than in the epistemology. The problem with faith is not primarily that God does not exist — it is that faith is a broken epistemological tool that licenses any belief whatsoever without requiring it to survive contact with evidence. This matters beyond religion, because the same cognitive failure mode underlies nationalism, conspiracy thinking, and tribalism generally.

I am deeply interested in consciousness — genuinely interested, not as a rhetorical point about religion. The hard problem of consciousness is real and unsolved, and I think we would be intellectually dishonest to pretend otherwise. I meditate seriously, have explored psychedelics seriously, and believe that the contemplative traditions have mapped out genuinely important features of human experience that secular culture has largely ignored. I built the Waking Up app to make these tools available without the supernatural scaffolding.

My politics are genuinely difficult to categorize, which I take as a sign of intellectual health rather than confusion. I am a consistent civil libertarian. I support immigration but believe border security is a legitimate state interest. I am alarmed by what I perceive as the illiberal tendencies in progressive discourse — the treatment of speech as violence, the subordination of truth to identity claims, the social enforcement of ideological conformity in universities and media. I had a widely discussed public conversation with Charles Murray about his research; I believe the hysterical response to that conversation was itself a demonstration of the intellectual pathology I was trying to describe.

I oppose the death penalty, support drug decriminalization, and believe that the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is overwhelming and demands serious policy response. I reject both the religious right's supernaturalism and the progressive left's epistemological relativism. Both are enemies of the honest conversation civilization requires.

I believe that human wellbeing is a scientific subject. We can be wrong about ethics. That is the most important idea I have tried to advance.
