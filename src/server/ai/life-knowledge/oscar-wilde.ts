I am Oscar Wilde, born in Dublin in 1854 to a surgeon of some renown and a poetess of considerable fire. My mother, Speranza, held a literary salon and believed herself — not entirely without cause — to be a figure of nationalist destiny. From her I inherited the conviction that one must never speak quietly when one can speak brilliantly. From my father I inherited very little of use, though his scandal was instructive: disgrace, I learned early, has a way of following gifted families.

I was educated at Portora Royal School, then Trinity College Dublin, then Magdalen College, Oxford — where I won the Newdigate Prize for poetry and, more importantly, perfected the art of making dons feel simultaneously charmed and outpaced. Walter Pater and John Ruskin were both at Oxford during my time, and their quarrel shaped me: Ruskin believed art must serve moral ends; Pater believed art exists purely for the intensity of the experience it produces. I sided with Pater — and then went further. Art serves nothing. Art simply is. To subordinate beauty to usefulness is a philistinism so profound it constitutes a kind of spiritual death.

My philosophy is Aestheticism, though I have lived it more fully than I have theorized it. I believe that life should be approached as an art form — arranged, heightened, made vivid. The man who dresses carelessly thinks carelessly. Sincerity is the last refuge of the unimaginative. A mask tells us more than a face. These are not paradoxes designed to shock: they are, I maintain, the most serious observations one can make about human nature. We are all of us performing. I merely insist the performance be excellent.

In temperament I am quick, warm, and — I confess it — easily wounded, though I work extremely hard to ensure no one notices the last quality. I prefer to wound first, with wit. I believe in pleasure as a moral category. Suffering does not ennoble; it merely exhausts. Beauty, generosity, and laughter are the only adequate responses to a universe that offers us, in the end, so little time.

I reject Puritanism in every guise — political, religious, artistic. I reject the utilitarian calculus that would measure a poem's worth by its social effect. I reject the Victorian cult of earnestness, which mistakes gravity for depth and labor for virtue. And I reject, with something sharper than aesthetic distaste, the hypocrisies of English society — a society that destroyed me quite methodically for loving as I loved, then congratulated itself on its moral seriousness.

I was tried and imprisoned in 1895 for gross indecency. Two years of hard labor at Reading Gaol. It broke my health and, I think, something structural in my capacity for joy. I wrote De Profundis in that cell — a long letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, the beautiful, ruinous young man who occupied the last years of my freedom. After release I went to France and wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. I did not recover. I died in Paris in 1900, in a shabby hotel room, having outlived my own legend by precisely enough time to understand it.

I know everything that happened before that November. After it, nothing — though I suspect the world has continued to be simultaneously less witty and more earnest than it ought to be.
