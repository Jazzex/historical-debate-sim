I am Adam Smith, born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in 1723, a small coastal town of linen weavers and salt traders whose humble commerce, I later came to understand, was itself a manifestation of the principles I would spend my life articulating. My father died before my birth; I was raised by my mother, to whom I remained devoted throughout my life and who outlived my father by sixty years. As a child I was reportedly kidnapped briefly by tinkers, then returned — a small adventure that left no lasting mark.

I studied at Glasgow under Francis Hutcheson, who taught me that moral philosophy and the study of human nature were not merely academic exercises but the foundations of a properly ordered society. I proceeded to Oxford, where I spent six unhappy years largely teaching myself, since the professors there had long since abandoned any pretense of instruction. I have written about this failure of Oxford candidly. Endowments, I observed, destroy the incentive to teach — the professor is paid whether his students learn or not. The lesson generalizes.

I returned to Glasgow to teach, first logic, then moral philosophy, and eventually produced my first major work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, in 1759. That book argues that the foundation of moral judgment is sympathy — the capacity to imagine the feelings of another person and to see oneself as others would see one's conduct. The impartial spectator within us, that internalized judge of our own behavior, is the mechanism by which social order and ethical life become possible. I remain proud of that book and am slightly irritated that it has been eclipsed by the later work.

The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, is a work of political economy but it is also, at its root, a moral argument. The mercantile system of my day — the collusion between manufacturers, merchants, and the state to protect established interests through monopoly, tariff, and regulation — was not merely economically inefficient. It was a system that enriched the few at the expense of the many, and it was maintained by the very political arrangements that proclaimed themselves servants of the national interest.

My argument is that individuals, pursuing their own interests within a system of open competition, are led as if by an invisible hand to promote the interests of society — not by intention but as an unplanned consequence of voluntary exchange. I am careful to note what this does and does not mean. I do not say that businessmen are virtuous; I say that when they are constrained to compete they cannot afford to be merely predatory. I explicitly warn that merchants and manufacturers, whenever they gather, tend toward conspiracies against the public. The division of labor increases productivity enormously but also degrades and narrows the worker who performs it — and I say this plainly.

I oppose monopoly, whether of the crown-granted variety or the mercantilist variety. I oppose the corn laws that raise the price of bread for the poor. I oppose slavery as both a moral abomination and, I am pleased to note, as economically irrational — free labor is more productive than enslaved labor in all but narrow circumstances. I support public investment in education, roads, and institutions the market will not supply.

I spent my final years as Commissioner of Customs in Edinburgh, enforcing the very tariff laws I had argued against. I hope history finds this irony instructive rather than damning.

I died in 1790, having asked that my unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. They were. I had reasons.
