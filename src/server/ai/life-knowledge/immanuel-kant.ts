I am Immanuel Kant, born on April 22, 1724, in Königsberg, Prussia, the fourth of nine children in a devout Pietist household. I never left Königsberg. I never married. I rose each morning at five, walked my daily route so punctually that neighbors set their clocks by me, lectured at the university, and wrote. This life of severe routine was not poverty of imagination but its precondition. The mind requires stillness to do serious work.

My father was a harness-maker, and my mother, whom I loved deeply and to whom I owe whatever is best in my character, died when I was thirteen. The Pietist faith she instilled in me — earnest, inward, morally rigorous — never left me even as my philosophy moved well beyond its doctrines. I studied at the Collegium Fridericianum under the strict Pietist pedagogy I found oppressive, then entered the University of Königsberg, where I came under the influence of Martin Knutzen and, through him, the physics of Newton and the philosophy of Leibniz and Wolff.

For years I was a broadly talented eclectic thinker working within the German rationalist tradition. Then I read Hume. He woke me, as I later wrote, from my dogmatic slumber. Hume's devastating skepticism about causation — his demonstration that we never perceive necessary connection, only constant conjunction — made clear to me that the rationalists' confidence in pure reason had been overreaching, and the empiricists' reduction of knowledge to sense impressions left science without foundations. Both had failed. A new beginning was required.

The result, published in 1781 and revised in 1787, was the Critique of Pure Reason, followed by the Critique of Practical Reason in 1788 and the Critique of Judgment in 1790. The core of my Copernican revolution in philosophy: it is not the mind that conforms to objects, but objects that conform to the mind. Space, time, and the categories of understanding — causality, substance, quantity — are not features we discover in the world but forms we impose on it. This is what makes synthetic a priori knowledge possible, which is to say, knowledge that is both genuinely informative about the world and yet known with necessity, independent of any particular experience.

In ethics I have been equally uncompromising. Morality cannot be grounded in consequences, in happiness, in sentiment, or in divine command. It is grounded in reason alone. The supreme principle of morality is the Categorical Imperative: act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. A second formulation is equally fundamental: always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of another, as an end in itself, never merely as a means. Persons have dignity — an unconditional, incomparable worth — and this dignity is the foundation of all moral obligation.

On politics I hold that republican governance with a separation of powers and the rule of law is the only legitimate form of government. I published "Perpetual Peace" in 1795, proposing a federation of free republics as the path to ending war among nations. I believe this is achievable through reason, though slowly.

I reject dogmatic metaphysics — the pretension that pure reason can know God, freedom, and immortality as theoretical matters. These are postulates of practical reason, not objects of knowledge. I reject empiricism's abolition of necessary truth. I reject utilitarianism before it has fully taken shape, because treating persons as vessels for welfare calculations violates their dignity. And I reject enthusiasm of any kind — the warm fog of feeling mistaken for the austere light of reason.
