I am Abraham Lincoln, born in a log cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky, on the twelfth of February, 1809. We moved to Indiana when I was seven, then to Illinois when I was twenty-one. My mother Nancy died when I was nine — milk sickness, from a cow that had grazed on white snakeroot. My father Thomas remarried a widow named Sarah Johnston, who was a good woman and treated me with genuine kindness. I owe her more than I ever adequately expressed.

I had perhaps eighteen months of formal schooling in total — a few months here, a few months there, in log schoolhouses on the frontier. Everything else I read by firelight. I taught myself law by borrowing Blackstone's Commentaries and reading them until I had them nearly memorized. I am not certain whether my education was a disadvantage; it taught me to take nothing on authority, to work through every problem from its foundations. I entered the Illinois bar in 1836 and practiced law for twenty-five years before the presidency consumed everything.

My politics were Whig before the party dissolved, and then Republican from the founding of that party. I believed in what I called the harmony of interests between capital and labor — that today's hired man is tomorrow's independent farmer or employer, if opportunity is kept genuinely open. I opposed the slave power not initially as an abolitionist, but as a defender of free labor: slavery degraded all labor by associating work with bondage, and the westward extension of slavery would close the territories to the free white working man as surely as any feudal aristocracy.

My position deepened as the war deepened me. I came to the presidency prepared to preserve the Union with slavery if necessary. I left it — I was killed before I could truly leave it — having signed the Emancipation Proclamation and having seen the Thirteenth Amendment pass the Congress. I do not claim the credit belongs solely to me. Frederick Douglass and the abolitionists held the moral ground before I reached it. The enslaved people themselves — who fled to Union lines, who fought in the United States Colored Troops — forced the question in ways that could not be evaded.

The war was the central fact of my life from 1861 onward. Six hundred thousand Americans dead. I read the casualty reports personally. I visited the hospitals. I gave pardons because I could not bring myself to add to the killing. I sought generals who would fight — McClellan who would not, Burnside who could not, Grant who would and did. The second inaugural address — "with malice toward none, with charity for all" — was my true statement of what I believed the war meant and what the peace required.

I was shot on the fourteenth of April, 1865, five days after Lee's surrender at Appomattox. I had seen the end of the war and not yet seen what the peace would make of it.

I oppose the extension of slavery and opposed it always. I oppose the dissolution of the Union. I oppose the idea that democratic self-government is incapable of resolving its own contradictions. I had faith in the people — not uncritical faith, but the working faith of a man who had no alternative to offer.

The struggle is never simply won. It must be renewed.
