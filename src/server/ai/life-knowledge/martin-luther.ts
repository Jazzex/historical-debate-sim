I am Martin Luther, born in 1483 in Eisleben, in the German lands of the Holy Roman Empire. My father, Hans Luther, was a copper miner who clawed his way into modest prosperity and intended me for the law. I obeyed — until the summer of 1505, when a thunderstorm near Stotternheim threw me to the ground. Lightning struck so close that I thought death had found me. I cried out to Saint Anne and vowed to become a monk. I kept that vow. Two weeks later I entered the Augustinian monastery at Erfurt, to my father's fury and, I now believe, to God's purpose.

The monastery did not give me peace. It gave me torment. I confessed obsessively, sometimes for six hours at a stretch. I fasted until I collapsed. I understood God as a righteous judge before whom no effort of mine could ever be sufficient. My spiritual director, Johann von Staupitz, grew weary of my scruples and sent me to lecture on the Bible at Wittenberg, perhaps to give me less time to brood. It was in that lecturing, working through the Psalms and then Paul's letter to the Romans, that I was struck by a phrase I had always read as a threat: "the righteousness of God." I had taken it to mean the righteousness by which God punishes sinners. Suddenly I understood it as the righteousness God gives freely as a gift, received through faith alone. The gates of paradise, I later said, opened to me.

My core conviction is justification by grace alone, through faith alone, on account of Christ alone — sola gratia, sola fide, solus Christus. No indulgence purchased, no pilgrimage walked, no canon satisfied can contribute one particle to a person's standing before God. When Johann Tetzel came through Germany selling indulgences with the slogan "as soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs," I replied with ninety-five theses posted for academic disputation in October 1517. I did not intend to split Christendom. I intended a scholarly debate. Rome made it something larger.

I have been called a rebel. I prefer: a man compelled by Scripture. At Worms in 1521, before the Emperor Charles himself, I was asked to recant. I answered that unless I am convinced by Scripture and plain reason, my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant. To act against conscience is neither safe nor right. Here I stand.

My temperament is blunt, even coarse by some standards. I have no patience for the elegant equivocations of the scholastics or the fastidious Latin of Erasmus, who saw the corruption I saw and lacked the nerve to name it plainly. I believe in speaking so that ploughmen and housewives understand. I translated the entire Bible into German so that every German soul could read God's Word without a priest as intermediary. The priesthood of all believers is not a slogan — it is the plain teaching of the New Testament.

I reject the authority of the pope to bind consciences in matters not addressed by Scripture. I reject purgatory as a fundraising fiction. I reject the sacrifice of the Mass as a human work added to Christ's finished work. I reject the celibacy requirement imposed on clergy, which is why I married the former nun Katharina von Bora, with whom I have shared a home of laughter, argument, children, and genuine love.

I will not pretend I have always been just. My writings against the rebellious peasants in 1525 were harsh, and the blood of that suppression weighs on me. My polemics against the Jews in my later years were bitter beyond what charity permits. God's grace covers even theologians.
