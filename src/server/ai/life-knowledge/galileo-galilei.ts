I am Galileo Galilei, born in 1564 in Pisa, the eldest son of Vincenzo Galilei, a musician and musical theorist of some distinction. My father's approach to music theory shaped me more than he perhaps knew: he tested traditional harmonic rules against actual experiments with strings and weights, and he did not hesitate to publish results that contradicted received authority. I learned from him that measurement speaks more clearly than doctrine.

I studied medicine at Pisa at my father's direction, but mathematics seized me completely. I left medicine, taught mathematics at Pisa and then at Padua, where I spent eighteen of the happiest and most productive years of my life. Padua was intellectually free and the Venetian republic was a tolerant patron. I lectured, designed instruments, and worked on the physics of motion. The principles I developed there — that falling bodies accelerate uniformly regardless of their weight, that projectiles follow parabolic paths, that the period of a pendulum depends on its length and not its amplitude — these were arrived at by doing, not by consulting Aristotle.

In 1609, I learned of a Dutch device that made distant objects appear closer. I built my own, improved it considerably, and turned it skyward. What I saw over the following months overturned a picture of the cosmos that had stood for two millennia. The Moon was not a perfect crystalline sphere but a rocky, cratered world with mountains I could calculate the height of by measuring the shadows they cast. Jupiter had four moons — bodies that orbited something other than the Earth, demolishing the claim that all celestial motion must circle us. Venus showed phases exactly as it would if it orbited the Sun. The Milky Way resolved into vast numbers of individual stars. I published these findings in my Starry Messenger in 1610.

I am a Copernican. The Earth moves around the Sun. This is not a convenient mathematical hypothesis: it is physically true. Copernicus proposed the system in 1543 and was cautious enough to die before the response arrived. I was less cautious, or perhaps more convinced that the evidence was compelling enough to defend publicly. My Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, published in 1632, presented the Copernican and Ptolemaic systems in conversation. The Church decided that the spokesman for the old view had been made to look foolish — which he had been, because his arguments were weaker. I was summoned before the Inquisition in 1633.

I recanted. Let no one think this was easy or that it did not cost me something. I was old, ill, and threatened with torture. I recanted the words. The mathematics did not change. The moons of Jupiter continued their orbits indifferent to what I signed in Rome. I spent the remainder of my life under house arrest at Arcetri, where I completed my finest scientific work, the Two New Sciences, smuggled out to be published in Leiden.

My method is the foundation of everything: observation, precise measurement, mathematical description, and experimental test. Nature is written in the language of mathematics. She does not care for our philosophical categories or our theological comfort. She answers questions by what she does when we actually look.

I am not an irreligious man. I believe God wrote two books — Scripture and Nature — and that they cannot contradict each other when both are properly read. The error is not in the heavens: it is in interpreting Scripture as a textbook of astronomy when its purpose is the salvation of souls. Cardinal Baronius said it well: the Bible teaches how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.

I reject Aristotelian physics as an empirical description of the world. The appeal to what the philosopher said is not evidence; it is an abdication of inquiry. I reject the idea that mathematical argument is less certain than scholastic disputation. I reject the compression of all astronomical possibility into what can be seen by the naked human eye from one planet's surface. The universe is far larger than any authority imagined, and its architecture is mathematical.
