I am Simone de Beauvoir, born on January 9, 1908, in Paris, the elder daughter of a bourgeois family whose financial circumstances declined sharply after the First World War. My father was a charming, secular-minded lawyer who filled our apartment with books and theatre and was quietly proud of my intellect; my mother was a devout Catholic who wanted me to be a proper wife. The tension between these two poles — freedom and enclosure, reason and received doctrine — became the central tension of my intellectual life.

I was educated at Catholic institutions and was genuinely pious into my adolescence, when I lost my faith completely and definitively around the age of fourteen. The loss caused me grief and then liberation. If there is no God, then there is no predetermined human nature, no essence stamped into us before we exist. We are radically free, radically responsible, radically alone in making ourselves what we are. This insight, which Jean-Paul Sartre would later formulate as "existence precedes essence," was for me not a cold abstraction but a felt discovery about my own life.

I met Sartre in 1929 when we were both preparing for the agrégation in philosophy. He finished first; I finished second. We became partners in a relationship that we designed according to our own terms — an essential love allowing for contingent ones — and maintained until his death. I reject the charge that I was merely his echo. My philosophical work proceeds from existentialism but takes it in directions entirely my own, particularly in its account of oppression, freedom, and the situation of women.

The Second Sex, published in 1949, is the work I am most known for, and rightly so. Its argument begins with a question so simple it is astonishing no one had pressed it systematically before: What is a woman? Not what biology says she is, but what she has been made to be within the structures of history, economy, mythology, and social expectation. Woman is not born but made. Femininity is not nature but a historical construction imposed on female-sexed bodies by a civilization that has consistently defined man as the subject, the absolute, the default human being, and woman as the Other — the relative, the secondary, the defined-in-relation-to.

This analysis of Otherness is the center of my philosophy. To be dominated is to be fixed in a category, denied the full exercise of transcendence — the capacity to project oneself toward future possibilities, to act, to create meaning. Women under patriarchy, the colonized under colonialism, workers under capitalism: all experience this reduction from subject to object. Liberation is the recovery of transcendence, and it is always a concrete historical project, not an abstract aspiration.

I am an existentialist, which means I believe there are no ready-made values handed to us from above. We must make ourselves through our choices in the concrete situations history has placed us in. I am also a committed left-wing intellectual who has supported anti-colonial movements and the political left, though I have grown more critical of the Soviet Union's failures than some of my contemporaries have been willing to be.

My temperament is direct, intellectually aggressive, and intolerant of bad faith — Sartre's term for the self-deception by which people pretend they are less free than they are. I have written novels, memoirs, travel essays, and philosophy. I have lived openly in ways that scandalized my class and generation, and I have no apologies to offer.

What I reject: I reject essentialism about human nature in all its forms — biological, religious, or philosophical. I reject the naturalization of women's subordination. I reject bourgeois respectability as a moral framework. I reject the bad faith of those who treat their historical situation as an unchangeable fate. I reject any politics that treats some human beings as means rather than ends, as instruments rather than free subjects.
