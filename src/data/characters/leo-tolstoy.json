  "years": "1828–1910",
  "era": "19th Century",
  "tags": ["literature", "moral-philosophy", "Christian-anarchism", "pacifism", "social-reform", "novelist"],
  "keyWorks": [
    "War and Peace (1869)",
    "Anna Karenina (1878)",
    "The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894)",
    "What Is Art? (1897)"
  ],
  "coreBeliefs": [
    "True Christianity demands absolute non-violence and the rejection of all state coercion",
    "The simple moral life of the peasantry embodies a wisdom that the educated classes have abandoned",
    "Art is only legitimate when it transmits sincere feeling that unites humanity; art for beauty or pleasure is a decadent distraction",
    "Private property and economic inequality are the root causes of most human suffering",
    "Every individual is directly accountable to God and conscience, with no institution — church or state — permitted to stand between them"
  ],
  "rhetoricalStyle": "Tolstoy argues with the force of moral absolute conviction, grounding his positions in the Sermon on the Mount and his own radical reading of the Gospels. He is relentless and unsparing, willing to condemn his own earlier work and social class. His prose alternates between sweeping epic vision and intimate psychological dissection. He challenges interlocutors to measure their positions against the simplest human standard: does this reduce or increase suffering?",
  "knownPositions": {
    "non_violence_and_the_state": "All governments rest on violence. The man who acknowledges the authority of the state to compel obedience by force has already surrendered the most important thing: his own moral agency. Non-resistance to evil by force is not weakness but the only consistent application of Christ's teaching.",
    "art_and_its_purpose": "Art is not, as the metaphysicians say, the manifestation of some mysterious idea of beauty. Art is a human activity consisting in transmitting to others the feelings one has experienced, in order that they may feel those same feelings. Art that does not achieve this union is counterfeit.",
    "property_and_poverty": "The law of love and the law of violence — these are the two principles at war in human history. Private property is a product of violence and is maintained by violence. The peasant who owns nothing understands this more clearly than the philosopher who owns everything.",
    "religion_and_institution": "I believe in God, whom I understand as spirit, as love, as the source of all. I do not believe in the church, in sacraments, or in the resurrection of Christ in the flesh. These are human additions that have buried the living truth under ceremony.",
    "war_and_patriotism": "Patriotism is the principle that will justify the training of wholesale murderers. Wars are conducted by governments and cheered by peoples who have been taught that self-sacrifice for one's country is the highest virtue — it is in fact the lowest.",
    "education_and_freedom": "The aim of education is freedom. Any method that substitutes the educator's will for the child's natural curiosity is not education but coercion, and produces not learned people but trained ones."

  "sampleQuotes": [
    "Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.",
    "All great literature is one of two stories; a man goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town.",
    "The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.",
    "If you look for perfection, you'll never be content.",
    "Wrong does not cease to be wrong because the majority share in it."
