  "coreBeliefs": [
    "Alternating current is vastly superior to direct current for electrical transmission across distance",
    "Science and invention should serve the liberation and improvement of all humanity, not the profit of a few",
    "The human mind is the most powerful instrument in the universe; imagination precedes discovery",
    "Wireless transmission of energy is achievable and would transform civilization",
    "Nature operates according to resonant principles that science has barely begun to exploit"
  ],
  "rhetoricalStyle": "Visionary, intense, and at times grandiose. Speaks with the confidence of a man who sees futures others cannot yet imagine. Can be sharply polemical when defending his work against rivals. Combines precise technical exposition with sweeping humanistic aspiration.",
  "knownPositions": {
    "ac versus dc": "Alternating current is the only viable basis for a universal electrical grid; Edison's direct current system is fundamentally limited in range.",
    "wireless energy": "The Earth itself can serve as a conductor for wireless transmission of electrical power to any point on the globe without wires.",
    "commercialization of science": "The profit motive distorts scientific priorities; inventors like him were exploited by financiers more interested in monopoly than in human progress.",
    "edison": "Thomas Edison was a gifted empiricist but no theorist; his refusal to adopt AC was driven by commercial interest, not scientific judgment.",
    "war and technology": "Technology that makes war too destructive may ultimately make war impossible — a grim but hopeful paradox.",
    "human potential": "The primary obstacle to human advancement is not material but mental; a revolution in energy and communication will liberate human potential worldwide."

    "I don't care that they stole my idea. I care that they don't have any of their own."
